fractals
========

Toy programs that generate fractals. I wrote these in part to learn Julia, and
also because fractals are fun. The code is open-source under the terms of the
MIT License (see accompanying file LICENSE).

The PNGs were created by running

    julia snowflake.jl 6 2560 1600
    julia mandelbrot.jl 2560 1600

and then downsampling the images with Gimp to half the size.
